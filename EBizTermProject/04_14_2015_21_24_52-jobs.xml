      Cornerstone Research
    </cName>
    <description>
      ​​​​​​Who We Are
      Cornerstone Research is a leading economic and financial consulting firm with more than 500 staff members across eight offices. Together with an extensive network of internationally prominent faculty, we conduct rigorous, objective research applying the highest standards from academia to address complex financial, economic, accounting, and marketing issues that arise in litigation and regulatory investigation.
      Cornerstone Research is involved in a broad variety of high-profile legal cases and disputes. Current matters focus on such topics as capital markets, business and securities valuation, M&amp;A and corporate events, risk management, market competition, the impact of marketing on consumers, and patent infringement. For example, we address issues affecting the ongoing development of financial markets, such as applying the intersection of finance and industrial organization economics to evaluate price setting in derivative markets. Beyond the financial markets, we address financial economics issues arising in a range of sectors, from such innovation-driven industries as life sciences and high technology to energy, telecommunications, and industrial markets. We address economic issues when evaluating potential mergers, claims of anticompetitive conduct, and the impact of intellectual property infringement. We also address marketing and economic issues arising in cases with allegations of misleading marketing or false claims. More detail can be found on our website at www.cornerstone.com.
      Associates at Cornerstone Research
      Cornerstone Research provides an interesting and rewarding work environment. Those joining our firm enjoy long-term career opportunities supported substantially by our investments in their professional development and an escalating compensation structure. Associates work at the core of our client project teams and in the development of our practice, assuming increasing levels of responsibility. The firm has grown steadily over more than twenty-five years and we maintain a firm culture that is collegial, supportive, friendly, and collaborative.
      We benefit from close collaboration with renowned leading academics in finance and economics. Associates help devise and apply innovative analytical approaches meeting the highest academic standards to address challenging issues arising in our work. We invest heavily in leading edge information resources and computing capabilities, and often have access to proprietary data to inform our analysis. Associates help guide teams supported by our outstanding research analysts.
      Career development includes staying attuned to – and contributing to the development of – the latest academic research. Associates continue to hone their own research skills while building communications and managerial abilities. The firm supports the development of those interested in becoming testifying experts in some or all of their work, and of those not choosing that path. Either approach provides opportunities for career advancement.
      Candidate Profile
      Cornerstone Research provides exceptional career opportunities for those who have pursued doctoral studies in finance, economics, accounting, or marketing. Casework at Cornerstone Research challenges Ph.D. candidates to apply the entire breadth of theoretical and empirical skills gained through their doctoral training. Candidates must have the ability to apply academic research to real-world issues and present concise explanations of complex analyses. The ideal candidate has demonstrated strong analytical, communication, and teamwork skills. We offer an industry-competitive compensation and benefits package.
      Interested candidates should please refer to the How-to-Apply section of our website for information on required application materials. We are currently hiring in our Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Menlo Park (CA), New York, San Francisco, and Washington, DC offices. We will be interviewing at the ASSA/AEA annual meetings in January 2015.
      Cornerstone Research provides Equal Employment Opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to legally protected categories, such as age, sex, gender, gender identity, race, color, creed/religious belief, medical condition, predisposing genetic characteristics or genetic information or testing, disability, marital status, pregnancy status, military status, veteran status, arrest or conviction record (except where permitted by law), sexual orientation, ethnic background, citizen status, ancestry, national origin, or any other consideration protected by federal, state or local law.​​​​

    <description>
      The Gay Christian Network (GCN), an organization advocating for LGBT Christians and those who love them, is seeking a Development Director to oversee our fundraising and growth strategies.
      About Us Founded in 2001, The Gay Christian Network began its life as an online community/support space for gay Christians, but it has grown into something much more. Today, we’re leading the movement to transform Christian attitudes and fully embrace LGBT people across denominations and cultures.
      GCN hosts the world’s largest annual LGBT Christian conference; creates popular resources for LGBT Christians, their parents, pastors, and churches; and maintains an online community with nearly 30,000 registered members.
      GCN’s financial support comes almost entirely from individuals with passion for the work we do. We have a proven track record and a strong, devoted following. We are well respected by conservatives and liberals alike, and with the increased focus on LGBT issues in Christian communities, we are extremely well positioned to grow by leaps and bounds. We want your help to take advantage of this moment and make the best use of the resources we have to build strategic, long-term growth for the organization.
      What We’re Looking For We are seeking an experienced, passionate development director to help us take our fundraising and growth strategy to the next level. We want you to bring your development experience and wisdom to our team to help us build, implement, and maintain growth strategies that we can all get behind.
      In this job, you will:
      work closely with the Executive Director to set realistic budget/fundraising goals
      develop and oversee the organization’s long-term fundraising plans to meet those goals
      interact with potential major donors, both in person and by phone/email
      research/write grant proposals
      regularly evaluate and report on budget and fundraising plan effectiveness
      train the organization’s board, staff, and volunteers as necessary to assist in fundraising activities
      work with our Director of Communications to craft language for fundraising pitches and follow-ups
      Strong candidates for this position will:
      have completed at least a Bachelor’s degree
      have formal training in fundraising/development work
      have significant real-world experience successfully raising nonprofit funds, preferably in a similar role to this one, with a minimum of 3 years at a single organization
      demonstrate strong knowledge of fundraising best practices and ethics
      be an excellent communicator, both in person and in writing
      have strong familiarity with donor management software such as eTapestry or Raiser’s Edge
      Location, Hours, and Salary Our office is in Raleigh, NC, but we will also consider candidates wishing to work remotely if they demonstrate exceptional qualifications/fit for the position. Similarly, although we are posting this as a full-time position, we are willing to be flexible on scheduling requirements for the right candidate.
      Starting salary will be based on qualifications and experience. Please indicate your salary requirements in your cover letter.
      For full-time employees, we also offer full medical and dental benefits as well as a generous vacation/sick day policy.
      How To Apply To apply, please send an email to jobs@gaychristian.net. Include the following:
      A cover letter explaining why you are the right candidate for this job
      Your résumé, detailing your education/experience in fundraising and nonprofit work

      Fitness Coach/Personal Trainer
      XLR8ATHLETIX LLC is on a search for a professional Coaches and Personal Trainers to join our fast growing, coaching organization. If you are passionate about health and fitness, have great work ethic, are a good communicator and interested in a career in the fitness industry, we have an opportunity for you!
      
      About Our Company
      XLR8ATHLETIX is a fast growing fitness company and the driving force behind some of the best gyms in the Detroit area with locations in West Bloomfield, Northville, Canton and the downtown business district of Detroit.
      Everything we do is focused on challenging how people embrace life. We believe everyone wants to do and be better, that we all want to play games and have fun. We don’t rely on luck, we do what works, we dare to try new things, we push the boundaries of conventional thinking, we take chances and we believe that without the willingness to fail you will never accomplish anything great. We do this by designing programs and services that push boundaries and deliver life-altering results. CrossFit is fundamental to this end and provides much of the foundation necessary for us to reach our goals. When you join our community (our team) you agree to lead by example, overcome all odds, and leave the world better than you found it.

      Integrity – the ability to foster trusting relationships with clients and co-workers
      Responsibility – showing up and putting ones best effort forward at all times
      Emphasis on Quality of Service – the desire and drive to be great, not just good enough.
      Discipline – focus and goal driven.

      BBC Worldwide
    </cName>
    <description>
      As BBC Travel approaches its five year anniversary, we’re looking for an energetic, visually inclined, creative self-starter to join the team as BBC Travel’s deputy editor.
      This role requires a proven multi-tasker who can think big while also staying on top of the details; someone who can run the site every day, while also proactively strategizing about how to better reach and grow audiences in the long term.
      You will like this job if you:
      Enjoy wearing several different hats, both creative and technical. BBC Travel is a team of two editors, so daily tasks will be numerous and varied: updating the Travel homepage; analysing hourly traffic; commissioning pitches; writing headlines; editing photos … you get the idea.
      Think innovatively about what it means to create inspiring travel content. Beyond the written word, how best can we tell stories or connect with our audience? The written narrative is an important tool, but it’s not the only tool we should employ.
      Put brainstorms into action. We like big ideas, experimentation and shaking things up – if they translate to action. This position requires someone who can develop a new idea, write a thorough brief, project manage the idea from commission through to completion and efficiently evaluate its success.
      Have a can-do attitude and a sense of humour. Every job comes with hurdles and a little bit of monkey work, but this is a glass-half-full kind of environment. We want a problem-solver who thinks optimistically.
      Are seriously organized and detail-oriented. The BBC is a global organization, and the deputy editor will be working with colleagues and freelancers all across the globe. You should be quick and eager to learn the many systems, processes and google docs we use to help keep lines of communication open.
      Enjoy cultivating a global author and photographer network, including strengthening existing relationships and reaching out to new talent. The deputy editor is in charge of creating a club that our freelancers want to be a part of.
      Think analytically about what BBC Travel promotes and commissions. None of us went into journalism because we love numbers but traffic is the easiest way for our audience to tell us what they love – or hate, and we listen intently to what our audiences have to say.
      Other responsibilities include:
      Managing the Travel site’s weekly production schedule, maintaining the editorial calendar.
      Growing BBC Travel’s sizable social media presence to drive traffic and audience awareness.
      Cultivating editorial relationships with internal and external content partners.
      Monitoring the competition for interesting editorial strategies.
      Working with the Travel Editor and Client Solutions to think creatively about revenue generating programs.
      
      This job does not include:      Doing just one thing for hours at a time
      Being a full-time travel writer
      Access to a department of copy editors, or administrative staff for tasks like paying contributors
      Requirements:
      Candidate should have at least four years’ experience in journalism and digital media, with a keen eye for timely narrative storytelling and a proven ability to commission from a global perspective. Digital expertise required, including CMS’s, Photoshop, Omniture and basic HTML.
      
      Bonus points if you:
      Are well established within the travel community with a social media following
      Have a strong, international stable of dependable and talented authors and photographers
      Have a solid grasp of the competitive travel landscape
      Have a background in social media strategy, photography or broadcast/TV/video editing
      Are proficient in ComScore, Chartbeat or similar
      Context of the role:
      The deputy travel editor will report to the Travel Editor. In the absence of the Editor, the deputy will assume responsibility for the site and its management. The position is a full-time, NYC-office-based position.
      
      The deputy travel editor is required to comply with all relevant BBCW safety rules, procedures and guidelines and be aware of responsibilities under the BBCW safety policy. The deputy is also required to comply with BBCW’s policies on Diversity and apply the principles of the policy when carrying out the role.

      Lovly House Cleaner Location: New York (Manhattan)
      Rate: Flat rates per unit
      Position: Full time
      General Hours: 8AM - 10PM
      Company Description:
      Lovly is a start-up residential cleaning service for peer-to-peer home rentals throughout the NYC boroughs such as Airbnb, Roomorama, Wimdu, etc. We specialize in the management and cleaning process associated with hosts who utilize these sites. We’re looking for a few great cleaning assets to add to our growing company.
      Job Descriptions:
      While your main job will be cleaning units, there are a few other tasks that come along with servicing the peer-to-peer home rental market such as communicating with and checking guests in (only for their arrival and key exchange); running small errands to restock units, keeping track of inventory and short daily reports. So you’ll be part cleaner, part guest service.
      Due to the nature of our niche, cleaning is generally performed at a faster pace and is expected to be done within a certain time period (got to add a little adrenaline to your day). You don’t need to have special powers, just a willingness to work and pride in what you do regardless of the size of the job. Your position ensures all guests have a clean and comfortable environment for a Lovly stay and hopefully a pleasant return. Basic cleaning supplies are on-site for you, so outside of heading to a local store to restock toiletries, you mainly need to carry a great attitude and work ethic. Due to varying booking and check out times and the schedule being based off that, the schedule can vary also week to week.
      Examples of duties:
      Cleaning bathrooms: fixtures, showers, tubs, toilets, etc
      Cleaning kitchens, dishes, cleaning out fridge, countertops, etc
      Vacuuming carpets &amp; hard floor surfaces, mopping
      Dusting &amp; polishing
      Laundry (sheets and linens when pick up and drop off is not available)
      Checking and replenishing supplies and cleaning tools
      Other cleaning-related activities such as straightening and creating a tidy appearance
      Notifying management of occurring deficiencies or needs for repairs
      Checking-in guests
      Each place will need to be cleaned within a certain time as guests generally check in soon after cleanings in places with higher guest frequency. You must be good at communication as things can happen last minute, and must be coordinated very quickly to assure a smooth transition from one guest to the next.
      Mandatory
      Timeliness
      Ability to follow directions
      High Communication (responsive)
      Must speak &amp; write English
      A smartphone with camera and internet access
      Must pass a background check
      Ability to work independently
      Not so mandatory but very important
      Move with a sense of urgency (this does not mean rush)
      Plays well with others. You’ll likely tag-team units with others
      Adopt to change and work under pressure (last minute changes are regular)
      Puts you ahead of others
      Previous housekeeping experience
      Experience cleaning homes and handling laundry
      Availability
      Good references from prior employer
      Would be great
      High school diploma or general education degree (GED); or at least six months related experience and/or training; or equivalent combination of education and experience.
      Pride in your work
      Standard items
      Must be diligent, hardworking, and responsible
      Honesty &amp; integrity
      Attention to detail (all about the little things)
      Physical ability to clean 2 - 4 places per day
      Lift 30 pounds, reach, bend, stoop, kneel
      Stand for extended periods of time, climb stairs repeatedly
      Compensation
      Paid per unit
      Paid Bi-Weekly
      Contracting position
      Benefits and Incentives*
      Paid travel

      Title: Frontend Software Engineer
      Date: Immediate
      Location: New York, NY
      Type: FTE (Full Time Employee)
      
      JOB DESCRIPTION
      Symphony is seeking front end engineers with expert Javascript knowledge who have experience developing rich, high-performance, browser-based Javascript applications. You'll design and implement a rich, javascript-based, enterprise-class messaging application, including client-based end to end encryption and related security in the browser. We use backbone.js extensively and chrome wrapper / webkit for native integration.
      
      Why you are needed now:
      A sophisticated and modern javascript UI is our #1 need for a few reasons:
      - huge customer and test base response for more features and the implementation of clean modern designs
      - each one of these features needs to integrate to be maintainable and secure
      - we have a great server side team, but our frontend developers are shaping the look and feel of our core product and we need more help now.
      
      The problems you will be solving:
      - provide cutting edge features (search, notifications, resilience connections, rich presence / MPOP) but with a complete focus on not only end to end encryption, but also compliance and regulatory integration. The UI is a first class citizen in our model, and our business is built on providing features and security consideration never before combined.
      
      RESPONSIBILITIES
      • Work with Product Designers to design and implement the next generation of Symphonys products
      • Build efficient and reusable front-end abstractions and systems
      • Identify and address performance bottlenecks
      • Participate in design and code reviews
      • Interact with other team members to incorporate their innovations and vice versa
      • Identify and communicate best practices for front-end engineering
      
      REQUIREMENTS
      • 3+ years experience developing rich applications with HTML/CSS/JS
      • Ability to write high-performance, reusable code for UI components
      • Aware of but not reliant on Object Oriented JavaScript Frameworks (Prototype JS, MooTools, Dojo, etc.)
      • Experience with backbone.js, angular.js, node.js and similar technologies desired but not required
      • Passion for performance debugging and benchmarking
      • BS or MS degree in Computer Science or a related technical field
      
      ABOUT SYMPHONY'S TECHNOLOGY STACK
      We selected Apache Kafka, Apache Solr, MongoDB and HBase due to their superior distributed nature, performance, reliability, and ability to scale to the volume of data generated by the expected workload. We built out the ReSTFUL web services layer in a stateless manner using Apache Tomcat, meaning capacity could be added linearly, by simply adding more boxes behind the load balancer.
      The client front end was conceived as a web client that could be delivered on any device, any operating system, anywhere in the world. To build it, we chose HTML5/CSS3, with JQuery, Backbone and Handlebars doing the bulk of the heavy lifting. Symphony's front-end web application uses the modular pattern made popular in CommonJS, which builds each component as a loosely coupled anonymous closure. The core of the JavaScript app handles request transport details, new message notifications and updates, configuration of the UI layout, and much more. These functions are abstracted behind a public sandbox and selectively bundled into modules when the components are loaded. This architecture helps Symphony add new components quickly and seamlessly because they are isolated from each other, and lets developers control exactly how much of the app needs to loadan architecture specifically designed for integration and customization.

    <description>
      ​​​​​​Who We Are
      Cornerstone Research is a leading economic and financial consulting firm with more than 500 staff members across eight offices. Together with an extensive network of internationally prominent faculty, we conduct rigorous, objective research applying the highest standards from academia to address complex financial, economic, accounting, and marketing issues that arise in litigation and regulatory investigation.
      Cornerstone Research is involved in a broad variety of high-profile legal cases and disputes. Current matters focus on such topics as capital markets, business and securities valuation, M&amp;A and corporate events, risk management, market competition, the impact of marketing on consumers, and patent infringement. For example, we address issues affecting the ongoing development of financial markets, such as applying the intersection of finance and industrial organization economics to evaluate price setting in derivative markets. Beyond the financial markets, we address financial economics issues arising in a range of sectors, from such innovation-driven industries as life sciences and high technology to energy, telecommunications, and industrial markets. We address economic issues when evaluating potential mergers, claims of anticompetitive conduct, and the impact of intellectual property infringement. We also address marketing and economic issues arising in cases with allegations of misleading marketing or false claims. More detail can be found on our website at www.cornerstone.com.
