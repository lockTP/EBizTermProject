Blair Corporation
##O***description***O##
Company Description It all started with a simple black raincoat. 
 The year was 1910. Young John Blair, a law student at the University of Pennsylvania, was approached by a fellow student who had recently inherited a raincoat factory. Would he be interested in being a sales manager? Easter vacation and a train ride home to Warren was all the time John needed to make his decision. 
 With a suitcase of black raincoats in hand, he approached clothing store owners along his way. In one nearby town, he sold a lone coat to a customer an undertaker. But the shop owner was reluctant to carry any more raincoats for just a few local undertakers. 
 John Blair was not about to give up. He decided the best way to reach the new market he had just created in his own mind the market of undertakers who would certainly wear black raincoats was by mail. So with just $500 borrowed capital, he printed and mailed flyers across the country. And he sold 1200 raincoats in no time! Thus, the New Process Company was created. 
 Over 100 years later, we've grown to offer exceptional clothing for women and men, plus quality items for your home. We've changed our name to simply, Blair. But we still proudly serve customers across the country. And we still maintain the high standards that John Blair built the company on so many years ago. 
 Our company headquarters is still located in the small town of Warren, Pennsylvania. We're proud of our heritage, our employees and our hometown!

  You will have the opportunity to work in a team of highly-skilled and experienced mobile developers to build and launch mobile apps that will be promoted by sports teams/stadiums as their official mobile app, and that will, therefore, be in the hands of millions of fans around the world.

Benefits include competitive salaries and medical+dental insurance.
  
 Why are we hiring?
  
 We are currently expanding rapidly to take on even more clients, more teams/stadiums and more sports, including overseas, and we are looking to grow our mobile team by adding full-time iOS developers to meet the demand for our products, and to bring even more innovations and features to our existing mobile offerings. Our company affords a close-knit entrepreneurial environment with every individual being exposed to, and having a tangible impact on, the company's business.
 Come join us, and you will be a part of developing the ultimate mobile experience for sports fans everywhere!

Wahila Creative
##O***description***O##
About UsWe focus on web applications for desktop and mobile, but in reality we take on all sizes and shapes of projects...
 Our services include everything from visual to interaction design, from schema design to platform specifications, and from development to long-term support (well, sometimes).
 We recently launched the Green Light Foods app with Phipps Conservatory and Botinical Gardens; a stock market visualization tool for Equivane; and a real-time status display used to track robotic forklifts (sorry, can't share that one).
 When we’re not building web apps, we’re building complex WordPress-driven sites for air curtain manufacturers (huh?) or maybe just bird watching (bald eagles, to be precise).
 In short, we tackle a wide range of projects, with a small team, and have fun while doing it.
 About YouJavascript on the client? check. Javascript on the server? check. We love it, and you do too.
 This position requires someone with a solid background in web development, but who isn't afraid to venture out of their comfort zone and learn something new. We love great design, creative solutions, and reusable code. We also like to laugh — mostly at ourselves.
 Typical responsibilities include server-side development using node, express.js, and mongodb; building, and deploying code to, hosted instances; creating killer WordPress solutions that involve a technical as well as an aesthetic sensitivity; and generally solving problems with code.
 Required Skills/Experience:
      Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, or 2+ years proven development experience.
     ESL (English as a Second Language) — since Javascript is clearly your first
     Demonstrable prowess with WordPress, Drupal, and/or other similar CMS.
     Ability to build a responsive site (desktop, tablet, phone).
  Prior Experience with any of the following is preferred — visual or interaction (UI/UX) experience; MEAN stacks; mobile application development (Cordova, Objective C, HTML5); MVC frameworks for web applications (such as Express or Code Igniter); test driven development; experience working with Object Oriented Design techniques; and command line interfaces (cli). The terminal is your friend.
 About the JobOur benefits include medical, dental, and vision insurance plans; and pre-tax commuter deductions. We offer a flexible work schedule and a casual dress work environment. We are a small (in number, not in height), collaborative, social, creative, and tech-savvy company.
 In short — Great people. Awesome projects. Flexible schedule. Coffee, Tea, Muffins, and more. Free corny jokes.
